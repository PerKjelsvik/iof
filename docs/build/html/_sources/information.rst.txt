Information
===========


This repository of code is the culimination of 1 year of software development from
NTNU master of `Cybernetics and Robotics` student Per Arne Kjelsvik. This is simple
documentation quickly added to the repository of the project, for easier inspection
of how the project code is built and works, as well as instructions on how to run it.

The documentation is currently far from complete, and there are probably some errors 
here and there due to it being autogenerated from code without a consistent docstring
format across all code. As the project matures, and the developer (me) gain more 
insight and experience, the usage of iof will hopefully improve too. At the same time
it is a goal to keep development easy for any potential newcomers to the project.
