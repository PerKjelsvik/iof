Frontend documentation
======================

This documentation is not complete at all. This is also because the state of the Dash application
is quite poor in terms of documentation. But for reference, the same guide given in the 
setup of new iof projects is given below.

Due to the way the Dash app is structured, the code must be run from 
inside the :code:`src/frontend/` folder. Navigate there, and for first-time
setup, run

.. code-block::

    python initfrontend.py

This will only work if backend has already been correctly initalized. If so,
the metadata for the current project will be converted to a frontend-compatible
file. It will then prompt you to add at least one username/password pair:

.. code-block::

    python initfrontend.py
    Done converting backend metadata to frontend metadata
    At least one username/password pair is needed for authentication.
    It will be stored next to the dash app in a toml file in plain text.
    username: dev
    password: pass
    Do you wish to add another username/password pair? [y/n]: n
    Successfully added username/password pair(s) to file! can now authenticate in Dash app.

You are now ready to run the Dah app. To run, simply run

.. code-block::

    python iof_app.py

and then go visit https://127.0.0.1:8050 in your web browser. This should load the 
iof Dash app, polling data from the main database located in :code:`src/backend/dbmanager/databases/`,
and using metadata to provide filtering options in the app.

The app is essentially a Flask app. Look up how to host Flask apps on webservers / other solutions for 
ways to make the app publicly available. The code you would have to change is the very last line of code
in :code:`iof_app.py`. Use the username/password combination
you provided in the initalization.


Structure
^^^^^^^^^

The website has controls on the left-hand side to switch between tag, tbr, and position data. If 
positioning is not included in the project metadata, the option to view the positioning data is
removed, along with the filters and options that come with it.
