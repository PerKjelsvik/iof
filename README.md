# Internet of Fish (IoF) repository

### Slightly updated readme august 2019

I have now started to continue my work on iof. I will work actively until friday 16.08.2019. After that I imagine there will be some updates here and there. To see the original form of the repo at the time of finishing my thesis, see the commit labeled [v.1.0](https://github.com/PerKjelsvik/iof/releases/tag/1.0). If you'd rather want to explore this commit here on GitHub, instead of downloading the source code, you can explore the repo directly here, [a8afc1b068](https://github.com/PerKjelsvik/iof/tree/a8afc1b068ac4d10d8111e0d299cad41a0a26e44). 

I will update this readme properly after my thesis has been evaluated, but I want to keep it's original form for now. The subsection below is the original readme descrition.

### Original readme

This repository is the result of my final year as a master student. The development of the code was done in a private repository. Opening up the original repository would be ideal, but there are confidental data and codes in the commit history. This repository was created as a fresh starting point for further development. 

The code for back-end in this repository should be fully working and ready to go. Front-end however is only included as documentation, since the Dash apps written are custom-made for the case study of the thesis. There are also several functions for both parts that could not be included. 

Regarding documentation files in the form of html / pdf / readthedocs. Documentation was generated with sphinx, but it was done so at a stage where it included several parts that could not be included. It was also in a rough state. New documentation will be added at a later date. 

This is a bare bones version of the repository and the code. Both will be updated in the future, but first there is a vacation to take care of :-)
