# IoF
Internet of Fish (IoF) repostiory.

This repository is the result of my final year as a master student. The development of the code was done in a private repository. Opening up the original repository would be ideal, but there are confidental data and codes in the commit history. This repository was created as a fresh starting point for further development. 

The code for back-end in this repository should be fully working and ready to go. Front-end however is only included as documentation, since the Dash apps written are custom-made for the case study of the thesis. There are also several functions for both parts that could not be included. 

Regarding documentation files in the form of html / pdf / readthedocs. Documentation was generated with sphinx, but it was done so at a stage where it included several parts that could not be included. It was also in a rough state. New documentation will be added at a later date. 

This is a bare bones version of the repository and the code. Both will be updated in the future, but first there is a vacation to take care of :-)
